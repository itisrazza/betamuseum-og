# BetaMuseum
## Experience Windows, Office, macOS and more in this museum
This was the first "full-size" website I've ever made when I was first learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

It was for an assessment Digital Technologies and it received an Excellence for the _NCEA Assessment Standard 91047 (Generic Technology 1.4)_.

## Problems
There are *many* problems with this website. At the time, I wasn't really aware of better ways to do things and kinda went with the flow.

## Changes from original submission
The following changes were made to the code.
* The website link was changed from `rareshnistor.cf` to `thegreatrazz.nz`, which is now my current website.
* The license link was changed from the license page on `rareshnistor.cf` to the one made by Creative Commons.

## License
I have changed the license to a `v4.0`. See [`COPYING`](COPYING) for more information.
